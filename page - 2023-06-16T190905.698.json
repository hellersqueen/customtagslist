Not from people scraping off that last bite of food into the disposal, but from companies dumping food before it ever gets to market.</a></p><p><a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthdig.com%2Feartotheground%2Fitem%2Fmore_vacant_homes_than_homeless_in_us_20111231&amp;t=NzAzZWJlNzkzNzYzZmQxYjI4MDMwODA3MzZhNTdkMjI4MDkwN2I4Niwwb2ZybHFuZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ALswkvmRMcxv_Ikz0CoNP1Q&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ffandomsandfeminism.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F155807909369%2Fswimminginthedesert-fandomsandfeminism-every&amp;m=1\">On a similar note, there are more vacant houses in the US than there are homeless people. </a> Vacant houses lower the property value of a neighborhood, as do the presence of homeless people. There’s an easy solution to this. </p><p>And you can’t just tell people&nbsp;“get a job.” Or that&nbsp;“well, people who CAN work, SHOULD work!

YES/NO? (PLS SAY YES)” with hearts in his eyes. (Chewie probably had to throw out like a HALF DOZEN old notebooks that were filled with awful power ballads/poetry/odes to her and “Mr. Han Organa” written in different fonts)</p><p>when it comes to the iconic ‘i know’ in response to Leia’s proclamtion of love, Ford has stated that it’s out of PURE CONCERN for HER FEELINGS (“the point is that I’m not worried about myself anymore, I’m worried about her” - DIRECT QUOTE), it was NOT a ‘boss’ move or ‘so swagtastic it hurts’ it was an apology that he couldn’t be there for her, it was an attempt to make her smile, to make it hurt less than if he had said the words too and then was forced to leave her. (not that he would have been much help; remember that&nbsp;han solo spends the majority of the 3rd film mostly blind and feeble, unable to take care of himself and generally getting in the way while Leia Gets Shit Done)</p><p>when he does say the words, it’s with the most adoring and awestruck expression. those words are fused with more than just love and respect. he’s almost HONOURED that he gets to love this badass babe and that she allows him to exist in her orbit.</p><p>&nbsp;AND THEN he loves Leia so much that he’s willing to step aside so she can be happy with the man he believes she wants. and valuing a woman’s choices and feelings over your own is not exactly womanizing behaviour - so where did this headcanon come from??</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719511147112529920/noblealice-ugh-like-there-is-literally-no"},{"originalPostUsername":"knighvtsofren","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small>\n\n“You’re a prefect?
