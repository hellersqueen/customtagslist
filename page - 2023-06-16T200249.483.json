I just finished my first year of college and I definitely have to credit the studyblr community for all the useful information and tips! I currently closed the year with a 4.0 and don’t plan on stopping!</p><p>&nbsp;In high school I was an ok student but I decided to change all that when I started college. So, whether you’re in high school or college, it’s never late to change and attain academic excellence! So here are my tips!&nbsp;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3000\" data-orig-height=\"1055\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/3a02f56f8790cb955a58167e988d947e/00c9f554f93d5992-7f/s1280x1920/2edd65c3c0f3470d304d46b94e8b630b7d42a4bf.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3000\" data-orig-height=\"1055\" width=\"700\" height=\"246\"></figure><h2>Try to get an early start on your day and sit closest to the front as possible. Studies show that sitting in the front of class will improve your grades and knowledge!&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>A study showed that those who sat in the front achieved an average of 80% while those in the middle achieved an average of 71.6% on their exams. And guess who did even worse.. unfortunately those in the back scored an average of 68.1%</li></ul><ul><li>Distractions are decreased because there’s no one sitting in front of you, just the lecture which basically forces you to pay attention.</li></ul><ul><li>This increases the likelihood of your professor getting to know you. Why is that important? <b>Well, in an accounting course I once took, I sat in the front, attended extra tutoring sessions hosted by that instructor, and generally put in extra effort in the class. By the end of the semester everyone was really struggling, over 20 students flunked out, and even my tips weren’t getting me to that A I wanted. Well, because I had established who I was and that I was serious about the class, my instructor bumped my final course grade from an 88% to 93%! She said she noticed the effort I put in so she gave me the grade she thought I deserved</b></li></ul><h2><b>Seriously, sit in the front!!&nbsp;</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"3000\" data-orig-height=\"1055\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/d0a1d0398dd9381784706cf5493603d1/00c9f554f93d5992-db/s1280x1920/74ed692cb86a9517ced8cd21bb206169f5d897d1.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3000\" data-orig-height=\"1055\" width=\"700\" height=\"246\"></figure><h2>Ok, now that you have a good spot in the class, make sure you take great notes!

I’ve always wanted one but it’s around the price of a textbook :(&nbsp;</li></ul><figure data-orig-width=\"3000\" data-orig-height=\"1055\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/ac7cd3689ae31ed917c0bfc68cb95a2c/00c9f554f93d5992-67/s1280x1920/1274948d040c5d653044e831bcd2a3e46f59f4e2.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3000\" data-orig-height=\"1055\" width=\"700\" height=\"246\"></figure><p>While Studyblr has so many resources and tips, in case you haven’t noticed, a lot of the pretty pictures use muji pens, staedtler fineliners, and those cute lil’ backpacks. Remember that you have to use supplies that work with you. Here are the essentials to carry with you:</p><ul><li><b>Notebooks and binders</b><br></li><li><b>A sturdy and comfy backpack.</b> I use the <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenorthface.com%2Fshop%2Fborealis&amp;t=ODEwZjE1MTJiNzQ2OTBmNGFlNWZiNzVhMDMyMzU4YTA1MjZlZmUxNyxZc0plTjRxMQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A_SxpvEmbjkpYPtAo3sKZnw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fgetbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F719149404703145984%2Ffoolproof-guide-to-school-success&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1686960163\">Borealis backpack </a>by The North Face on discount. Make sure it has comfortable straps, back support, enough room for all your stuff, and compartments for <b>your food and water bottle.&nbsp;</b><br></li><li><b>A phone charger. </b>Keep it in your backpack. My phone has died on me so many times and it sucks, especially if you have to take the bus. Invest in a portable charger.</li><li><b>Earbuds</b> are a must, especially if you take public transportation. Also great for when you’re at the library, gym, etc.</li><li>As previously mentioned, <b>a water bottle and FOOD!</b> Pack a lunch but also have backup snacks like granola bars or nuts. You need food and water for energy. &nbsp;</li><li>Keep<b> extra change.</b> You never know when you need it!!&nbsp;</li><li>Your <b>planner</b>.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Pens, pencils, etc.</b> Especially a stapler if you have homework that you regularly turn in!! Its really awk when someone doesn’t have a stapler and everyone in the class doesn’t either..</li><li>A laptop, seriously a must! Chromebooks are affordable!&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Hope that’s helpful!
