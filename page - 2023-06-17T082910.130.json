The time you spend sitting in bed aimlessly browsing the Internet instead of finishing that video game you thought was fun or going out with a friend to see a movie or getting up and doing your laundry. You exist, and it’s okay, but you’re not really sure why. You’re not doing anything productive when you have all the time in the world to be doing it. You feel like you’re missing out on life, but at the same time you feel that it doesn’t really matter. That’s the worst kind of depression.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718244348265906176/lowhtml-the-reason-depression-is-literally-the"},{"originalPostURL":"https://carrow.tumblr.com/post/163686753761","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mORsCXXQK_HKglN1OtnI8AA\">@hpeditsnet</a> creation event: Get to know our members week</p><pre>☞&nbsp;Day 3: Your Hogwarts house</pre><blockquote><p><i>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you’ve a ready mind, where those of wit and learning will always find their kind.</i></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718244345539592192/carrow-hpeditsnet-creation-event-get-to-know"},{"originalPostURL":"https://scurviesdisneyblog.tumblr.com/post/156396157453","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>Moana and Grandma Tala by Jin Kim (<a href=\"https://href.li/?http://conceptartworld.com/books/the-art-of-moana/\">x</a>)</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718244342830137345/scurviesdisneyblog-moana-and-grandma-tala-by-jin"},{"originalPostURL":"https://anthonystan.tumblr.com/post/163567140845","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p><small>“The chemistry between you two…I know everyone keeps saying it’s the bromance between Cap and Bucky but…”</small><br></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718244340161478656/anthonystan-the-chemistry-between-you-twoi-know"},{"originalPostURL":"https://saoirseunaronan.tumblr.com/post/163509660502","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p><small>\n\nYou get the information, and it’s not your job to judge it or not judge it.
