We\nnever get to see anyone taking proper care of him after he left Shmi. It seems\nlike everyone just assumed he’d be fine. He was left to sleep on the floor, no\nexplain to him what would happen to him, no one told if he was supposed to stay\nwith Padmé or follow Qui-Gon until the very last second, no one explain how\nthis worked in this new and strange planet and no one thought “hey this dirty\nchild might use a proper shower and some new clothes”. Maybe I’m being too\nharsh but it’s something so basic I’ve a hard time finding excuses for everyone\ninvolved in the situation. They had the clothes and the fabrics, they had the\nwater and they had a starship filled with adults and servants. “They were too\nbusy to notice” is not a good enough excuse to let the kid who saved them all\nrun around (in a goddamned battle!!!!) wearing rags.</p><p>The sad\npart is Anakin was only cleaned after he traded his slave outfit for a new\n<strike>slave outfit</strike> jedi robe. </p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718422448902668288/padawanlost-thewillowbends-replied-i"},{"originalPostURL":"https://saffie-art.tumblr.com/post/164406380064","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>A little progress shot of a piece I started before school consumed all of my free time.
