[{"originalPostUsername":"erykahisnotokay","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                        <p>She shouldn’t have been allowed to speak anyways considering <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/scarlett-johansson-doubles-down-support-israeli-settlements\">she supports Israel</a>, <a href=\"https://href.li/?http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/scarlett-johansson-calls-dylan-farrow-letter-irresponsible-article-1.1723934\">victim blamed Dylan Farrow</a> after she publicly denounced Woody Allen and those celebrities <a href=\"https://href.li/?http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-actors-continue-working-woody-893289\">who still support him</a>, and has taken roles from women of color. It’s especially gross she was given this platform when the majority of the organizers are women of color and&nbsp;one of the organizers of the Women’s March is literally a <a href=\"https://href.li/?http://www.arabamericanny.org/lindasarsour/\">Muslim Palestinian woma</a>n.<br></p><p>Johansson said, literally out of her own mouth, that she would support Trump if he supported women and would give her [Johansson’s] daughter the same reproductive health care “privileges” as Ivanka Trump had in her youth.&nbsp;This is after she made statements like “don’t let the helplessness make you complacent”, as if standing in the middle of a crowd of thousands of women marching for their rights is the appropriate venue to talk about people’s complacency.</p><p>I won’t force myself to go through the full seven minute drivel she poured out on that stage before being cut off, but those two statements alone show the gigantic gap in understanding the struggle’s of being a woman in America when you come from the most privileged groups of women in the country, if not the world.</p><p>Reproductive health care is never a privilege and the fact that it is ever viewed as such is an affront to women’s humanity. &nbsp;This isn’t the “March for Women’s Privileges and Special Treatment”, this is a march for the rights which women, by nature of being humans, are entitled to have recognized by the government and those in office.&nbsp;</p><p>For Scarlett Johansson to make her speech about her as an individual and to even think to speak the words “I will support [Trump]” is abhorrent. It flies in the face of the entire purpose of the March. This isn’t about bargaining rights for patriotism, it’s about demanding rights and promising resistance if they’re not acknowledged.&nbsp;To stand in front of a crowd of so many women from so many backgrounds and say “I, a White cis woman, will support your oppression of others so long as I’m looked out for” is the epitome of White supremacism through the feminist lens.</p><p>White women don’t belong in leadership positions in movements for women’s rights, and honestly they don’t belong in leadership positions of any movement seeking to recognize and protect human rights. They don’t get it and they can never get it. They shouldn’t be given a platform to prove that time and time again at the expense of the women of color, trans women, disabled women, and etc. who they carelessly speak over.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719619784111767552/the-whole-thing-with-scarlett-johansson-is-exactly"},{"originalPostURL":"https://msjosephinemarch.tumblr.com/post/156297514180","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><div><small><i>and that’s probably why i feel outta place<br> making music that make white college kids feel safe</i></small><p><small>happy 35th birthday, daveed diggs (01.24.1982)</small></p></div></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719619781338284032/msjosephinemarch-and-thats-probably-why-i-feel"},{"originalPostURL":"https://cortexifansquint.tumblr.com/post/156204937859","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><div><small><b><a href=\"http://cortexifansquint.tumblr.com/tagged/bvmeme\">buffyverse meme</a></b>: [7/8] supernatural creatures<br><i>Of course we want trouble.
