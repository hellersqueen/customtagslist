The time to use them is perhaps near at hand. Bear them well.” With these words he handed to Peter a shield and a sword. The shield was the colour of silver and across it there ramped a red lion, as bright as a ripe strawberry at the moment when you pick it. The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed, and it was just the right size and weight for Peter to use. Peter was silent and solemn as he received these gifts, for he felt they were a very serious kind of present.</i><br></small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717501546387193856/lvcypev-pevensienet-challenge-4-the-6-weeks"},{"originalPostURL":"https://trashybooksforladies.tumblr.com/post/150132209114","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><b>Legacy?</b> What is a legacy?</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717501543660847104/trashybooksforladies-legacy-what-is-a-legacy"},{"originalPostURL":"https://sattelite-of-love.tumblr.com/post/168396244138","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><i><b>angel</b> - s3e13</i></small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717501540929323008/sattelite-of-love-angel-s3e13"},{"originalPostUsername":"audreys-brooke","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><div><small><a href=\"http://audreys-brooke.tumblr.com/tagged/50char\"><b>top 50 televison characters</b> (as voted by my followers)</a> → <b>#42.</b> katherine pierce</small></div></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717501538296315904/audreys-brooke-top-50-televison-characters-as"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/confirmed%3A-rick-o%27connell-will-rock-back-and-forth-in-a-hug-for-comfort\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">#confirmed: rick o'connell will rock back and forth in a hug for comfort</a><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/her-character-development-from-1-to-2-is-my-fave-but-what-they-did-with-rick-is-some-nice-work\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">&nbsp;
