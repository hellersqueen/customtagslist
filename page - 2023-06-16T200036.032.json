Most of us never found the time to get to know you, but that doesn’t mean we haven’t noticed you. We don’t talk about it much, but it’s no secret that Sunnydale High isn’t really like other high schools. A lot of weird stuff happens here.\n\n\nBut whenever there was a problem or something creepy happened, you seemed to show up and stop it. Most of the people here have been saved by you or helped by you at one time or another. We’re proud to say that the class of ‘99 has the lowest mortality rate of any graduating class in Sunnydale history, and we know at least part of that is because of you. So the senior class offers its thanks and gives you this.\n\n It’s from all of us, and it has written here, <b>“Buffy Summers, Class Protector”</b>. &nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719149894584221696/surnmersbuffy-were-not-good-friends-most-of"},{"originalPostURL":"https://alarkling.tumblr.com/post/153863948991","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><a href=\"http://alarkling.tumblr.com/tagged/meme:%20ca\">character aesthetics</a>:<b> rose tyler<br></b></small></p><p><small>you don’t just give up. you don’t just let things happen. <b>you make a stand!</b> you say no! you have the guts to say what’s right, even when everyone else just runs away.</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719149645972029440/alarkling-character-aesthetics-rose-tyler-you"},{"originalPostUsername":"andrxwminvard","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><b><a href=\"http://andrxwminvard.tumblr.com/tagged/characterposters\">character posters:</a></b> percy jackson and the olympians/heroes of olympus<br>\n↳ percy jackson</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719149642182524928/andrxwminvard-character-posters-percy-jackson"},{"originalPostURL":"https://orlandobloom.tumblr.com/post/154697259395","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><i>The Force is strong in my family.
