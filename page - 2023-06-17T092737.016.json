(ex:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hekaterine.tumblr.com/post/73599308311\">x</a>&nbsp;)</li><li>Apollo enjoying counterculture modern music that isn’t what your grandaddy listens to because the god of music loves all music</li><li>Hermes dropping the internet connection of late-night bloggers when he thinks they need to get more sleep</li><li>Aphrodite at the forefront of modern fashion, not just for mainstream fashion but all types of beauty</li><li>Apollo keeping tabs on the mental health of all his followers because mental illness is illness too</li><li>Hera rejecting political campaigns and bringing together queer couples because the goddess of marriage knows better than some old congressman what marriage is</li><li>Zeus traveling the world enjoying the various diversity of his world under culturally-appropriate disguises in each country, stopping to perform quiet blessings to people who deserve it and yet who never know who that strange older man was who helped them or gave them exactly the sort of wise guidance they needed</li><li>Ares annoying Apollo by constantly demanding updates on the wellbeing of his injured veterans and wanting to know what Apollo plans to do about their combat-related injuries and mental illnesses</li><li>Ares whispering in the ears of anti-war protesters to keep world governments from using nuclear weapons</li><li>Ares deflecting bullets in a firefight to protect police officers chasing a gunman and casually pushing criminals’ vehicles off the road in car chases before they can hurt any innocents</li><li>Athena on the ground in the Middle East, following around military scouts and diverting attacks before they even notice them</li><li>Hermes disguised as a male nurse, quietly walking between beds in terminal care facilities, easing pain in everyone he passes by</li><li>Haides patiently explaining the whole “yes, I’m that Haides” “yes, this is that underworld” “no, no one’s going to torture you with fire” thing to every single person who enters his realm and never getting frustrated no matter how many times the Christians ask him about hell</li><li>Poseidon getting a drink in the local bars in small coastal towns because he likes to listen to the tall tales the fishermen tell as they come in from their crab boats</li><li>Hephaestus gleefully inventing new creations because smithing is so much more interesting with modern technology</li><li>Demeter convincing Zeus to sabotage the political lobbying of big agricultural corporations to protect her beloved small-time farmers</li><li>Hestia strolling through the suburbs calming down family arguments in the neighborhoods she visits</li><li>Artemis taking her responsibility for the wellbeing of young ladies seriously and invisibly sitting next to every heartbroken teenage girl crying her eyes out over some lost highschool love</li><li>Dionysus impersonating bartenders and demanding patrons’ car keys when they’ve had too much</li><li><strong>Gods that aren’t stuck in the ancient past</strong></li></ul>\n
