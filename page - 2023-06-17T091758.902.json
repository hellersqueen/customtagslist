I was altering my personality and the photos I’d put up on social media and the emojis I’d use—every little thing. It was a full-time job. What that does is keep building shame, without you even realizing it. Honestly, I didn’t come out to inspire others. I couldn’t actually process anybody else’s thoughts, because that’s what was keeping me afraid. I did it for myself, but then, once I realized the effect it had on other people, it became this beautiful thing. And I can go anywhere now and be me. I’m a better actor, a better musician, and a better person.”\n\n</small><br></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717974295180132352/softbramsimon-i-was-making-decisions-based-on"},{"originalPostURL":"https://prettyzinta.tumblr.com/post/171936809305","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><b><a href=\"http://prettyzinta.tumblr.com/tagged/moodboard\">moodboard</a> :</b>&nbsp;<i>slytherin</i><br></p><blockquote><p><i><i><i><i>“ </i></i>\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin<br></i><i>You’ll make your real friends,</i><br><i>Those cunning folks use any means</i><br><i>To achieve their ends.</i><i><i>”</i></i><br></i></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717974292461240320/prettyzinta-moodboard-slytherin-or"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717974289761058816"},{"originalPostURL":"https://marveladdicts.tumblr.com/post/171214451889","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><sup>“As a kid, I loved going to lots of thrift stores with my parents.
