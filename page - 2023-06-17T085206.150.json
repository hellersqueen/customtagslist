I find it the easiest and most therapeutic to be able to write about my experiences in that way, and that’s how I get things off my chest. It used to be scary when I’m writing about a certain experience and I’m worried about the person I’m writing about will find out it’s about them. But I’m no longer worried. I’m really okay with people knowing certain songs are about them. I just feel good about it. But yes, I’m okay.
