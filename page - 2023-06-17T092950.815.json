picky where they spend their energy. taurus’ can be very passionate, being ruled by venus, and when it’s something they care about taurus will go to the ends of the earth to achieve what they want.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>gemini:</i></b> feels extremely deeply. always trying to dissect why they feel the way they do instead of embracing it. mask pain with wittiness and sarcasm. never honest with themselves though they can be so brutally blunt with others.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>cancer:</i></b> probably has anger issues or anxiety. because cancer’s feel so deeply, they look for an outlet to release these emotions. anger is the one i’ve seen the most - cancer’s are volatile and find a way to hurt the person they take their anger out on - they go for the kill shot.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>leo:</i></b> way more insecure than they front. many leo’s are physically confident, as we all know, but, like gemini’s, leo’s couldn’t be more emotionally insecure. they love the idea of love, but they’re terrified of emotional intimacy.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>virgo:</i></b> their controlling organization comes from a lack of control over their heart. virgo’s - much like gemini - can have flitting attraction. their interest is temporary, as they enjoy a mystery, but only for so long. it’s a very fine line to keep the affections of a virgo, as they’re extremely picky with who they settle.&nbsp;\n</p><p><b><i>libra:</i></b> can be completely cold-hearted. scorpio’s and cancer’s get angry, but usually out of emotion, and it’s evident that no matter what they say they still care. libra’s however, have a switch that completely detaches them from all feelings when they’re pissed. will make you question if they ever even cared.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>scorpio:</i></b> common perception of scorpio’s is that they’re kinky and sexual bastards, when really they are one of the few signs who views sex as an act of love rather than of physical feelings. scorpio’s only have sex with people they love - it’s more their heart than body.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>sagittarius:</i></b> that wanderlust spirit is rooted deeply in fear. sagittarius fear attachment to one place or person for too long; it’s why they tend to travel. either physically or emotionally, locking down a sagittarius is very difficult, but not because they just want to see the world, but because they are very distrustful in nature.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>capricorn: </i></b>like gemini, capricorn are very emotional. however, capricorn tend to ignore feelings instead of trying to understand them.  known as driven, they tend to focus all their energy on a single thing, and think that emotion is a distraction from their goals. &nbsp;</p><p><b><i>aquarius:</i></b> super loyal. even though aquarius are very opportunistic and tend to take the route they think is the best for themselves, they also have a very compassionate side to those they sympathize with. aquarius’ hearts are difficult to capture, but once you do they’re also difficult to lose. \n\n<br></p><p><b><i>pisces:</i></b> much more manipulative than perceived. pisces may feel deeply - as a water sign - but they use this to their advantage. pisces have a wicked accurate gut feeling due to how deeply in tune their are with their own emotions. if a pisces thinks that you can benefit them, they will use you.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717787455319834624/unusual-truths-about-the-signs"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717787452614508544"},{"originalPostURL":"https://reducto1.tumblr.com/post/60084998409","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p>I always thought Pink Floyd’s Dark side of the moon is a good OST for Iron Man falling from outer space</p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fsociety6.com%2Fproduct%2Firon-man-falls_print%231%3D45&amp;t=Y2I1N2JlNDA0NTBkN2FmZjM4ZWNiMTdhNmZhZDFjM2NkY2RkN2FkYixuRU5qdlp2TA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A_SxpvEmbjkpYPtAo3sKZnw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fgetbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F717787449858965504%2Freducto1-i-always-thought-pink-floyds-dark-side&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1687008587\">[Prints]</a>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717787449858965504/reducto1-i-always-thought-pink-floyds-dark-side"},{"originalPostURL":"https://rihardgansey.tumblr.com/post/160620322406","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>hundred badass ladies <a href=\"http://rihardgansey.tumblr.com/tagged/100\">➼</a>&nbsp;mulan<br></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717787444488060928/rihardgansey-hundred-badass-ladies-mulan"},{"originalPostURL":"https://princess-of-pokemon.tumblr.com/post/165716445775","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                        <p>me: *scares myself to the point where I can’t even function because of the anxiety I have created over a situation*</p><p>the situation: *works out fine*</p><p>me: oh</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717787441708318720/princess-of-pokemon-me-scares-myself-to-the"},{"originalPostURL":"https://professor-quirrell.tumblr.com/post/163213032197","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><small><b>A Series of random-ass Starkid parallels (2/<a href=\"http://professor-quirrell.tumblr.com/tagged/asorasp\">??</a>)</b><br></small></p><blockquote><p><small>a handy guide on how to upset Lavender Brown<br></small></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717787438995685376/professor-quirrell-a-series-of-random-ass"}]
