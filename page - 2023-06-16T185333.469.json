It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs an unspoken rule that I can‚Äôt hope for more than one, maybe two non-straight characters or relationships because any more would be ‚Äòunrealistic‚Äô or ‚Äòpandering‚Äô. Fucking pander to me man, to all the other queer people invested in the worlds you create, because it‚Äôs not fair that because there‚Äôs a lesbian couple there‚Äôs an invisible cap and now I‚Äôll never see a bi main character, or that having a trans side character is ‚Äúenough activism‚Äù and that trans character will never have another friend on the show like them.
