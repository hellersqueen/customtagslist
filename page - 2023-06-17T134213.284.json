I really don’t think I fully…when I was 14, 15, 16, 17–I mean I knew as sure as I know that I am wearing green shoes that I was going to die before much happened. It was a certainty for me. And I had shaken off the directly suicidal urge by the time I was 21 or 22, but I still was pretty sure I was going to die pretty young, it really felt like an inevitability. It takes a long time to realize no, you’ve changed…if you shared those feelings with people at some point you go, ‘well, I guess we’re going to stick around.’ And it’s a funky thing to admit because there’s a part of your inner younger self that kind of judges you for that.”</p><p>John Darnielle fucking me up with the single most relatable thing he’s ever said </p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/716352777920659456/shawnhenryspencer-i-dont-think-that-i-accepted"},{"originalPostURL":"https://aliciavilkander.tumblr.com/post/173483505796","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><b><a href=\"http://aliciavilkander.tumblr.com/tagged/fcmb\">character moodboard</a></b> | molly weasley (née prewett)</p><p>“<i>You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!’ screamed Mrs. Weasley.&nbsp;</i>Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backwards through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did.
