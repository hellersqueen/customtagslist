Looks quiet enough. Some thought he looked like a kid. They were wrong. He wears gloves. Hides the twin lions tattooed on his palms. Everything goes though him, see? All the blood, all of their crimes and death sentences, it’s all on those hands. His heart is stone. And they listen to him. He don’t yell, no one’s ever heard him. But people listen when he speaks. They kill for him. </i></p><p><i>And Susan, oh, she’s a looker, ain’t she. Looks like she’d be a sweet thing. Dangerous though, like poison. She has a way of getting what she wants. And no one ever gets in her way. She’s got lions on her mouth of all places. Behind her lips. Say it’s like magic, lets her kisses get you drunk and spilling secrets. But that’s probably just her.</i></p><p><i>Then they’re the dark one. Edmund. No one really knows what he looks like. You probably would’ve recognize him until he put a bullet though your skull at 20 paces. A shadow, he is. Mothers tell their children stories about him to get them to behave. Don’t go out at night, or he’ll get you. Don’t feel like a story when your neighbor says his brother was killed by a man with a lion over his heart.</i></p><p><i>Lucy, now she’s the tiny one. That’s where it fools ‘em, ain’t it. They laugh, then their voice cuts out because they’re on the floor, one swing of the crowbar all it takes. She’s the best muscle they’ve got, and that’s the facts. She’s got a lion at the hollow of her throat– right at the spot where her knife might land. Then she would wipe it clean, smile, and go to church to pray for your soul.</i></p><p><i>The Pevensie’s <b>rule</b> these streets, kid.
