When they go to their knees, however, you must help them back to their feet. Elsewise no man will ever bend the knee to you. And any man who must say <i>‘I am the king’</i> is no true king at all. Aerys never understood that, but you will. When I’ve won your war for you, we will restore the king’s peace and the king’s justice.\n\n</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066079581290496/littlemisswhoever-house-lannister-a-song-of-ice"},{"originalPostURL":"https://dailykatherinepierce.tumblr.com/post/167342933876","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>You can hate me, but we want the same thing.</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066076855009280/dailykatherinepierce-you-can-hate-me-but-we-want"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066074131808256"},{"originalPostUsername":"dawefincher","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><i>✨ &nbsp;<small><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/edit/167267304336/dawefincher.tumblr.com/tagged/getinloser\">magical shops</a></small></i><br></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066071418159104/dawefincher-magical-shops"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066068695957504"},{"originalPostURL":"https://giffingbuffy.tumblr.com/post/164599741220","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p><small><b><a href=\"http://giffingbuffy.tumblr.com/tagged/bangelweek\">buffy/angel appreciation week</a></b> » day six › <i>favourite parallel</i></small><br></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066065946607616/giffingbuffy-buffyangel-appreciation-week-day"},{"originalPostURL":"https://pvnk-leia.tumblr.com/post/146041234984","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                        <p>sometimes i remember that george lucas is the biggest fucking homophobe and that advocating for gay luke is really important because lucas has said over and over that gay people “don’t exist” in the sw comics and apparently threatened to sue gay fans who were publishing their writing in zines, and hyper-masculinized luke in the comics because he thought it would make mlm relate to him less and created a character and romantic arc out of pure hatred for men who love men and that mlm have seen themselves in luke for decades and deserve that representation full fucking stop.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066063220326400/gay-male-privilege-pvnk-leia-sometimes-i"},{"originalPostURL":"https://greelin.tumblr.com/post/151827082068","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                        <p>boy howdy i sure do sound ugly when i speak and laugh and breathe and look ugly when i’m awake and sleeping and alive</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066060513984512/greelin-boy-howdy-i-sure-do-sound-ugly-when-i"}]
