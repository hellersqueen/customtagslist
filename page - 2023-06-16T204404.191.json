The big bad for season four is summoned Literally Any Other Way. Cordelia never goes into a coma or dies. Instead she joins Wolfram and Hart with the rest, and she’s juggling being a working mom to a half-demon baby through the final season and it’s hilarious and awesome. She’s like an amazing dragon mom. All the zany baby stories are perfectly apt metaphors for actual parenthood, with just minor comedic magical emphasis. She doesn’t die at the end of the series either. She just fucking lives to fight and be a cool mom.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718882758488915968/timemachineyeah-angel-the-series-rewrite-where"},{"originalPostUsername":"mermaidbuffy","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><b><a href=\"http://mermaidbuffy.tumblr.com/tagged/buffy%20summers%20appreciation%20week\">buffy summers appreciation week</a></b>: day three - <i>favorite hairstyle(s)</i></small></p><p><small>❝ Buffy, Buffy, Buffy!
