People have been having gay sex since forever. People have been having interracial sex since forever. So what tradition are you referring to exactly? Nationalism? That shit’s only been around for like 150 years and even then two nightmare wars later and people are weary as fuck of those kind of attitudes.</p><p>The idea that people in the past were morally pure is a pervasive myth. Do you know that humans were making mead before they were growing crops? Do you know that there’s a reason prostitution is called “the oldest profession”? Have you seen the dirty graffiti they sprawled on the walls in Pompeii?</p><p>Traditionalists are suffering from the fallacy of presentism, the belief that things around them that they don’t like are new and the things they do like have been around for a long long time.
