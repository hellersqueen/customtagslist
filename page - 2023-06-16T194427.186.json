I always thought that finding someone beautiful and wanting to touch or kiss them <i>was</i>&nbsp;sexual attraction, but realizing that it’s not, that sexual attraction means actually desiring sexual acts with a person, has changed my life and explained so many things. When I was figuring this out, a number of other people commented that they felt the exact same as me, so I think this is some pretty important stuff to spread around.</p><p><a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asexuality.org%2Fen%2F&amp;t=YWVlYTZkZTA0MGJlZGE0YmU5ZTM1YWMyNjIyNmZiODBiMmM5NDY3YixQSGQ4N1l6OA%3D%3D\">Click here if you think might be asexual</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdemisexuality.org%2F&amp;t=YmJmNDgwNjQ5MDlmMWFhMGE4OTQ2NmQ4YzZiN2UyNzI4NjFkZDg2NixQSGQ4N1l6OA%3D%3D\">or here if you think you might be demisexual</a>.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719327379882934272/three-kinds-of-attraction-and-why-its-important"},{"originalPostURL":"https://analysingbooks.tumblr.com/post/131231059698","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.analysingbooks.tumblr.com/tagged/btvs%20episodes\">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>: Graduation Day, Part 1</p><blockquote><p><i>“This is mutiny.”<br>“I like to think of it as graduation.”</i><br></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719327377305550848/analysingbooks-buffy-the-vampire-slayer"}]
