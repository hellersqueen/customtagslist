I had the chance to watch how one of these big icebergs turns itself around in water creating a huge wave and making a lot of noise. Awesome!</p><p>As the ice constantly moves you’ll never have the same scene twice which makes every picture unique.”</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717080609314553856/vurtual-by-dennisf-this-is-a-photograph-of"},{"originalPostURL":"https://weare90skids.tumblr.com/post/171271695402","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p>\n\n❤️\n\n4ever ❤️<a href=\"http://weare90skids.tumblr.com/tagged/make-me-choose\"><b><br></b></a></p><figure><a class=\"post_media_photo_anchor\" data-big-photo=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/704e530e5b8355e1ce37911444d91803/45596bcdc6c2e18b-a1/s1280x1920/2428c561b087146e7204a51fff4a91f880b55293.gifv\" data-big-photo-height=\"160\" data-big-photo-width=\"245\"><img class=\"post_media_photo image\" src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/704e530e5b8355e1ce37911444d91803/45596bcdc6c2e18b-a1/s250x400/874bb8dbd1bb149bcf9c7c3fe272e4bb02776fc3.gifv\" alt=\"image\"></a></figure><p><a href=\"http://weare90skids.tumblr.com/tagged/make-me-choose\"><b>make me choose</b></a>: Bangel or <strike>Cangel</strike> (requested by anon) <br></p><blockquote><p>I’ll never forget.
