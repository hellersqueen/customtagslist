Britain only did because they viewed national boundaries as of divine import. Churchill liked Hitler until he started invading other countries. Pro-Nazi rallies were held across this nation, including at Madison Square Garden. Hitler directly praised American efforts at state-sponsored eugenics and treatment of Native Americans. </p><p>Stop playing Captain America. It really is a fluke of history that the United States sided against the Nazis. This election is not in defiance of American political culture, it is a fulfillment of it.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719074154037592064/legally-bitchtastic-kellanium"}]
