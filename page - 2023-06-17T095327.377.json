It is life giving, renewing and means new beginnings. It can also mean happiness, youth, new beginnings, wealth and original ideas. Overall, it is seen as a positive force. Sunshine feels and looks good, so we embrace it.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</i> ends with the sun shining. The slayers have been ‘awoken’, and the battle in the Hellmouth is over. We don’t know what’s next for Buffy Summers- yet judging by her smile, it can only be positive. She’s got her life ahead of her. The ending to this saga is heartwarming and feel-good, as well as leaving the viewer with a sense of triumph.</p><p><b>Rain </b>is more bittersweet and melancholic. Some theorize that rain is the tears of God, men- and even angels. Rain is grim and hard to understand, but ultimately nourishing for the earth. Despite how grim and impactful rain can be, it is worthy of our understanding.</p><p><i>Angel </i>ends in rain, during the night. LA has never been darker, the forces of Wolfram &amp; Hart are out to kill them. If rain symbolizes pain and hardship, then it’ll never stop raining for Angel. He must keep fighting, and the fight will never end for him. It’s a tense, powerful ending that stays with the audience for days. It’s not a cliffhanger- but merely reaffirms what the series is about. <i>If Nothing We Do Matters, Then All That Matters Is What We Do.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</i> shows a fight that has been finished. <i>Angel </i>shows a fight that will never stop.</p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717600954823933952/saintmichaelthearchangel-buffy-the-vampire"},{"originalPostURL":"https://stiles-lydia.tumblr.com/post/164962291117","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small>You mean about going to France?</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717600952071389184/stiles-lydia-you-mean-about-going-to-france"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717600949310472192/what-we-thought-2017-would-be-like-flying-cars"},{"originalPostURL":"https://karouss.tumblr.com/post/163770613326","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><a href=\"http://karouss.tumblr.com/tagged/my-character-posters\">character posters ☆</a><b> spider-man: homecoming</b>&nbsp;<b>// peter parker</b></p><blockquote><p><i>“look, i’m just gonna be myself.”</i></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717600946578948096/karouss-character-posters-spider-man"},{"originalPostURL":"https://lesbabeths.tumblr.com/post/163733205115","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p>Character Posters: Piper McLean</p><p>→ Don’t think, just <i>feel</i>.</p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717600943857926144/lesbabeths-character-posters-piper-mclean"},{"originalPostUsername":"beaataaass","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>NARNIA WEEK 2017\nday 1 - favorite female character\n–&gt; lucy pevensie</p><p>❝i think i could be brave enough.❞</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717600938417963008/beaataaass-narnia-week-2017-day-1-favorite"}]
