I kind of stared in shock — I mean I love my lady villains. I love nasty female villains. I love sneaky and clever female villains. I love female villains that wrap themselves up in what the patriarchy expects of them and uses those expectations to smash someone upside the head.&nbsp;</p><p>I tried to explain my hatred of Umbridge isn’t that she’s full of traditionally feminine attributes. &nbsp;</p><p>It’s that she’s&nbsp;<i>lawful evil.&nbsp;</i></p><p>If you did an alignment chart, no one would represent lawful evil more than Umbridge. I don’t think there’s ever been a character that better sums up lawful evil.&nbsp;</p><p>And, to me, lawful evil is the most terrifying and disturbing evil there is.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, lawful evil is the shit that gets thousands of people killed while the person responsible walks away feeling like they did their duty.&nbsp;</p><p>Evil forces like Bellatrix and Voldemort are fairy tales. They’re the bad guys a good guy can chase away with a sword or wand.&nbsp;</p><p>Umbridge is that evil that really does lurk in the hearts of men (and women). The realness, the plausibility of it, makes her amazingly uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>So, yeah, I can’t get as excited about her as a fantasy book creation as easily as some other female villains. Not because she’s a woman, or because of her gender presentation, but because she represents a sort of evil that’s far, far too close to home.&nbsp;<i><br></i></p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073787857993728/hufflepunkx-too-bassoon-firesnaps-i-had"},{"originalPostURL":"https://gloriouscreatorbear.tumblr.com/post/154869426225","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>Thoughts and Prayers with Carrie Fisher</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073785168429056/gloriouscreatorbear-thoughts-and-prayers-with"},{"originalPostURL":"https://reynahs.tumblr.com/post/154809319836","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><small><b><a href=\"http://reynahs.tumblr.com/tagged/2016-br\">BOOKS READ IN 2016:</a></b> The Hidden Oracle by Rick Riordan</small></p><blockquote><p><small><i>“Things can turn out differently, Apollo.
