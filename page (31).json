My inner critic is strong, but I know that I am stronger. I can’t get rid of him. He’ll always be there. A voice in my head telling me to not even dare to dream for something more. But that is exactly what makes me so fierce. Because even with his voice, his monstrous size filling up the space underneath my skin, I still choose to try. And I still choose to believe.\n\n</small><br></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/720057396659126272/flawlessbeautyqueens-i-have-been-blessed-with"},{"originalPostURL":"https://pavlovpuppy.tumblr.com/post/172428011059","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                        <p></p><p><b>space documentary:</b><i>&nbsp;</i>In about 5 billion years, our sun will enter its red giant phase, destroying Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth as well.</p><p><b>me, knowing full well that there’s no way I will be alive by then:</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"379\" data-orig-width=\"590\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c698d7db1fae27b1f8d5cad89be196a0/42a3c86031f8fbea-83/s640x960/837c85d1ebdf6fc733fe431f5e5f55f9e32748fb.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"379\" data-orig-width=\"590\" width=\"590\" height=\"379\" alt=\"image\"></figure>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/720057394248499200/pavlovpuppy-space-documentary-in-about-5"},{"originalPostURL":"https://housefaery.tumblr.com/post/156416279775","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p>\n\nAttention, squad…<br></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/720057391285141504/housefaery-attention-squad"},{"originalPostURL":"https://bellathorvne.tumblr.com/post/172204698242","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><b>Everything has been a climb and I’ve been able to take my family and friends with me.</b> I came from humble beginnings.
