Not just the picture of Butthead on the punching bag but this, where I said I wanted to get a couple of shots. We were going fast – and that one, I didn’t know if I was going to use the two of them. And to me it’s almost the most important shot in the show because it really shows the mystery of their relationship. And that’s one where I wanted the audience to fill in the blanks. I wanted them – I wanted whatever you want to have happened, to have happened. If people believe that on their last night together they made love, great! If they believe that on their last night together they talked all night, great! If they believe that they had a fight, great!</small><br><br><small>Whatever it is, it’s up to the viewer and I think that the viewer has earned that, and I love that elliptical nature of their last night together. I think that there should be work for the viewer to do, in that sense, emotionally, because I think it makes it more textured. And that shot of the two of them looking at each other, I just find beautiful.</small></p></blockquote><p>Joss Whedon, ‘Chosen’ <a href=\"https://href.li/?http://stormwreath.livejournal.com/53253.html\">commentary</a></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719507852077711360/marilynmay-and-this-bit-here-i-did-actually-add"},{"originalPostURL":"https://jiltedjohn.tumblr.com/post/120826072543","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><b>Alia Shawkat</b> for <i>Nylon</i> magazine, July 2015 issue.</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719507827391070208/jiltedjohn-alia-shawkat-for-nylon-magazine-july"},{"originalPostUsername":"thatposeidonkid","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p>Annabae&nbsp; (◡‿◡ )</p><p>Because she is the ultimate bae and I love her.<br>Also featuring a crappy drawn laptop&nbsp;(ʘ‿ʘ )&nbsp;</p><h2><i>Do not remove my text from my posts!</i></h2>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719507824349184000/thatposeidonkid-annabae-because-she-is"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719507820999049216"},{"originalPostURL":"https://justjensenanddean.tumblr.com/post/629183074900525057","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><b>Jensen Ackles</b></small><small> | Inside of You Podcast with Michael Rosenbaum &nbsp;</small><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KviOroHeU\"><small>[x]</small></a><br></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719452151205838848/justjensenanddean-jensen-ackles-inside-of-you"},{"originalPostURL":"https://aescademic.tumblr.com/post/154725791725","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><b><a href=\"http://aescademic.tumblr.com/tagged/**\">transitional words for essays</a> </b>[<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.pinterest.com/pin/832251206108989651/\">source</a>]<b> </b>/ [click for <i>high res!</i>]<br>→ some transitional phrases for essays, made into an infographic…<i>!</i> —tia ♪&nbsp;</p><p><b>[+++] </b><br><a href=\"http://aescademic.tumblr.com/tagged/!infographic\">more infographics</a> / <a href=\"http://aescademic.tumblr.com/tagged/**\">uploads</a>&nbsp;/ <a href=\"http://aescademic.tumblr.com/faq\">have a question?</a></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719419405002522624/aescademic-transitional-words-for-essays"}]
