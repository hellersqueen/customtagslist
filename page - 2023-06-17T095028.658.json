The President of Barbuda says that 90% of the island is uninhabitable, upwards of 60% of the <i><b>TOTAL</b></i> population are now homeless because the hurricane destroyed virtually every building and home on the island, and that the estimated damage is valued at no less than $200 million dollars. That’s money a small island like that doesn’t have. They’re saying it’s going to take years to rebuild and Hurricane Jose is right behind Irma on the same path which means they could be hit twice. This is just <b>one</b> of the islands being affected. </p><p>Please, show up for the Caribbean like you did for Houston. There is no safety net for any of these islands including mine. They’ll rely entirely on foreign aid. Find local charities or global trustworthy charities <i><strike>(NOT the Red Cross)</strike></i> and make a donation asking them to aid the Caribbean. There’s whole countries being turned into rubble with no financial means to repair their infrastructures. They’re going to need help. </p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717601166165458944/guys-the-first-images-of-irmas-level-of"},{"originalPostURL":"https://brakstr.tumblr.com/post/164651693171","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>i wanted to draw hazel in a pretty dress pt,2</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717601163479072768/brakstr-i-wanted-to-draw-hazel-in-a-pretty-dress"},{"originalPostURL":"https://thepunisher.tumblr.com/post/152905370843","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><i><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/relatable\">#relatable</a></i><br></small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717601117141417984/thepunisher-relatable"},{"originalPostURL":"https://entanglin.tumblr.com/post/162108830419","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>sailing, my love<br>\nPassed by this on my lil stroll @ the park today!!</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717601114352205824/entanglin-sailing-my-love-passed-by-this-on-my"},{"originalPostURL":"https://hello-shellhead.tumblr.com/post/113812129356","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><a href=\"http://hello-shellhead.tumblr.com/post/113788691156/got-new-heart-shaped-sunglasses-today\">I love my new glasses!</a></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/717601111581868032/hello-shellhead-i-love-my-new-glasses"},{"originalPostURL":"https://whenshewasbad.tumblr.com/post/164152126821","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><b>I see such pretty fire. </b><small>And pain.
