Peter is so desperate to get back to Narnia, so desperate to be of use again to his kingdom. And he finally makes it back, just to have to try and prove that he is, in fact, a worthy king. But it doesn’t go according to plan - at all. His soldiers followed him into this battle, every single one of them trusted him with their lives and now he is forced to watch as they die, forced to leave them behind and save his own life. And he is <i>horrified</i>. He may blame Caspian as well later on, mostly in anger, but in this moment he blames only himself. <br></p><p>And remember, this boy is about 18 years old (at most). <i>He is just a boy</i>.<br></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718065494171795456/lumox-high-king-peter-the-magnificent-this"},{"originalPostURL":"https://howlingremus.tumblr.com/post/163610336534","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><b><small>neville longbottom <i>(remake of <a href=\"https://href.li/?http://remusjohn.co.vu/post/155273824014/harry-potter-character-posters-1-neville\">this</a>)</i></small></b></p><blockquote><p><small><i>“w<i>e were all in the d.a. together. it was all supposed to be about fighting you-know-who, wasn’t it? and this is the first chance we’ve had to do something real — or was that all just a game or something?</i>”<br></i></small></p></blockquote><p><b><small>b. 7-30-81</small></b></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718065491487440896/howlingremus-neville-longbottom-remake-of"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718065488733863936"},{"originalPostURL":"https://thorodinson.tumblr.com/post/167166940189","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><i>I’m not a queen, or a monster.
