That moment that in a gust of wind or in the rumbling sky or at the edge of a fog bank where suddenly, you feel different. A restlessness, a sense of longing for a place that does not exist. I don’t know if anyone else has felt the electric tense changing of that moment. It calls the magic to your skin. For a moment, you feel ancient and powerful and lonely, as if you forgot something important. Witch weather. For some reason, in that wild instant: you remember you are alive, and that means some part of you belongs to the everlasting.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417812773388288/inkskinned-i-dont-know-my-favorite-was-always"},{"originalPostURL":"https://lupinteddys.tumblr.com/post/130879292136","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small><i>The Silver Trio</i> [<a href=\"http://lupinteddys.tumblr.com/post/130755903171/were-coming-with-you-that-was-decided-months\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">The Golden Trio</a>]</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417802863362048/lupinteddys-the-silver-trio-the-golden-trio"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417794779824128"},{"originalPostUsername":"ira-ubert","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                        <p>Because some people don’t seem to get it: when I say “I don’t trust men I don’t know” I don’t mean “I hate those little babies with Y chromosomes, they are Bad” what I mean is “I don’t trust our society to raise good men at a ratio I find acceptable.” Have you SEEN pop culture? Have you seen gamer culture? Have you seen the peer pressure boys undergo? Have you seen an Axe ad, like, ever? Media doesn’t just bounce off of developing minds. Someone is consuming these messages in bucketloads. This stuff sells. Misogyny sells. Yeah, some dudes overcome it or aren’t as susceptible to it. But how many? I’d wager less than half. So when I say “I don’t trust men,” when you need to pass a sort of clearance stage before I am comfortable with you, it’s like I need to pull out my meter that detects radiation levels except the radiation is misogyny and if you have saturated yourself in it I want to keep that shit away from me. What is so hard to accept about this?</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417787772239872/ira-ubert-because-some-people-dont-seem-to-get"},{"originalPostURL":"https://waricka.tumblr.com/post/132351448958","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>someone requested Narcissa !!<br></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417783872618497/waricka-someone-requested-narcissa"},{"originalPostURL":"https://digorykirke.tumblr.com/post/132028571735","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small>\nyeah, we’re alright though\n\n</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417780465696768/digorykirke-yeah-were-alright-though"},{"originalPostURL":"https://lovelifelove2013.tumblr.com/post/127577196048","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><small>\n\nOnce is an accident, twice is a coincidence, three times is a pattern.<br></small></p><blockquote><p><small><i><i><i>- “<b>First love,</b> you remember what that’s like?<b> Trust me I do.</b>”</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</i>“Sometimes, history does<b> repeat </b>itself Scott.“&nbsp;</i></small></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417775155707904/lovelifelove2013-once-is-an-accident-twice-is"},{"originalPostURL":"https://snuffls.tumblr.com/post/154608017788","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><small><b><a href=\"https://href.li/?denied:snuffls.tumblr.com/tagged/mine:%20mb\">hp moodboards</a>:</b> dean thomas</small></p><blockquote><p><small><i>“we’re fighting, aren’t we? the message said harry was back, and we were going to fight! i’ll have to get a wand, though…”</i></small></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417770453942272/snuffls-hp-moodboards-dean-thomas-were"},{"originalPostURL":"https://mamalaz.tumblr.com/post/131960387302","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>Harry Potter Subjects</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417762265563136/mamalaz-harry-potter-subjects"},{"originalPostURL":"https://sydneybristowe.tumblr.com/post/76880127663","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><sub><strong>Lindsey</strong>&nbsp;: What was your name?<br></sub><sub><strong>Darla</strong>&nbsp;: <em>I don’t remember.
