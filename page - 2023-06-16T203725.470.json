It is not a Navajo thing. It is not an Indian thing. It is a Plains thing.</p><p>Stop calling every silly thing you draw that even vaguely resembles a native “Cherokee” or “Navajo” or “Aztec.”</p><p>Stop drawing the warbonnet everywhere as the apparently definitive native thing. It isn’t part of all of our 600+ cultures.</p><p>Same goes for the tipi, not part of every one of the 600+ indigenous cultures.</p><p>Stop thinking that if a native person doesn’t have dark, “mahogany” skin, that their heritage is invalid. Even without admixture, we actually do have varying skin tones.</p><p>Stop wearing crappy fake warbonnets. </p><p>Stop wearing redface.</p><p>Stop using us as your silly mascots. We are people.</p><p>Stop saying “spirit animal.” It’s derived from a New Age bastardization of a something that actually exists in some of our cultures. </p><p>Don’t smudge. Cleanse all you like, that’s fine, but don’t smudge.</p><p>Don’t call us “Indians.” “Native American” isn’t great either, it is not our name, but it’s slightly better than “Indian.” “Indigenous” is also fine. </p><p>Don’t use NDN/ndn. That is ours.</p><p>Step off about our hair. If you meet a long-haired native, admire it if you like, maybe even ask them about it (RESPECTFULLY), but do not touch. The same applies for someone with short hair, but additionally for those with short hair, don’t say things like “oh you’d look more native/Indian/etc if your hair was long.” We didn’t all traditionally have long, flowing hair. Believe it or not, there are actually different haircuts existing in our various cultures, and aside from that ultimately it’s a personal choice, one does not need to have long hair if they don’t want to. Doesn’t make them any less native to have short hair.</p><p>Don’t pray to our spirits/gods/energies. Native spiritualities are closed, they are not for outsiders.</p><p>Don’t say “The Native Americans believed…” Firstly, the past tense is silly, we still exist and do things. Secondly, we are NOT A MONOLITH. As I mentioned before, there are upwards of 600 different Native American cultures.</p><p>Don’t ask about someone’s “Indian name.” That’s not only insensitive, the name you are referring to in that instance is something sacred, and might not be something that person wants to share with you.</p><p>Don’t call yourself silly crap like “howling wolf” or “flying eagle.” That’s also racist and insensitive.</p><p>Regardless of whatever you might think you’re doing, or what your intentions may be, if a native person tells you that what you’re doing is disrespectful, STOP DOING IT.</p><p>You aren’t honoring us. You’re just mocking us further, demonstrating your continued ability to treat us like shit and get away with it even now, centuries after our colonization began. Your feelings are not more important than our history and survival.</p><p>To those doing your best as allies, thank you, keep doing what you do. HOWEVER, don’t let opportunities to educate others escape you. By letting them continue to be ignorant, you are failing. Spread the message.</p><p>There will be no “please.” It’s been more than 500 years, and we still are made to be invisible in our homelands. Still we are treated like less. Some even think we all died long ago.</p><p>We are still here</p><p>We will still be here</p><p>Treat us with respect.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718883180939182080/dear-non-natives"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718883164272099328"}]
