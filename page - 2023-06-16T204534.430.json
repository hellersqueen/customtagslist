It also kind of pressures the person suffering to kind of come up with something FOR you to do. Like I get so frustrated with that first question as a person who gets it a lot.</p><p>The second not only takes the pressure off but also might help the person really consider what their actual needs are like hey I haven’t eaten, maybe that’s a reason I feel crappy. It kinda takes the asker out of the immediate picture so the person struggling can focus on what they actually need, and then if you CAN help, you can offer it.</p><p>We’ll see if this works better!</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718882646533554177/totalspiffage-my-therapist-suggested-replacing"},{"originalPostURL":"https://cryisbabys.tumblr.com/post/159492066807","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>\n\nBe emotional, create, learn, grow repeat. \n\n<br></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718882642557304832/cryisbabys-be-emotional-create-learn-grow"},{"originalPostURL":"https://annabcth.tumblr.com/post/159497732064","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small>Make ten men feel like a hundred.</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718882638951219200/annabcth-make-ten-men-feel-like-a-hundred"},{"originalPostURL":"https://feistiest.tumblr.com/post/120578082681","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                        <p><b>me:</b> *thinks about how completely and utterly bi percy jackson is*</p><p><b>me:</b> 👌👀👌👀👌👀👌👀👌👀 good shit go౦ԁ sHit👌 thats ✔ some good👌👌shit right👌👌th 👌 ere👌👌👌 right✔there ✔✔if i do ƽaү so my selｆ 💯 &nbsp;i say so 💯 &nbsp;thats what im talking about right there right there (chorus: ʳᶦᵍʰᵗ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ) mMMMMᎷМ💯 👌👌 👌НO0ОଠＯOOＯOОଠଠOoooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ👌 👌👌 👌💯 👌 👀 👀 👀 👌👌Good shit</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718882635252924416/feistiest-me-thinks-about-how-completely-and"},{"originalPostURL":"https://halosydnes.tumblr.com/post/144265678366","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p><small>I wanna <b>feel that sea breeze.</b></small></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718882631551500288/halosydnes-i-wanna-feel-that-sea-breeze"}]
