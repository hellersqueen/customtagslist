And they grew slowly and worked through both of their insecurities and became an even stronger couple?? and then the writers tried to bring back rachel/ross again and it just,,,,,,didn’t compare because chandler and monica had surpassed their trash dynamic by 1000x at that point. anyway, god bless chandler and monica</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719685536163463168/malfxoys-the-best-part-about-friends-is-that-it"},{"originalPostURL":"https://tfa.tumblr.com/post/154090849545","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small>Remember, the Force will be with you.
