It’s just really exciting like I turned to like a little kid again, in a way. You know, because we’ve all gone on to, in between these films, we’ve had years, you know, growing up. We’re in our mid to late 20s now, most of us, all of us. And I find myself kind of becoming that little, you know, my little crazy like energetic self, who sprinted up to Thomas the first day I saw him in the production office on the first one, and I just wanted to meet him so bad, you know. And just that excitement that we all… kind of an energy that we all created with each other in the first movie that just kind of snaps right back in, I guess. <b>I don’t know, as soon as I see everyone again i’m just like… I turn into a person I only am with them in a way.

White millennials are not inherently less racist than white baby boomers and racism does not disappear with a generation. Racism is a construct that exists in all aspects of society, from politics to economics to social norms and activities. It can only be eradicated with constant and fervent dismantling of these powerful constructs in place and new generations must keep working at it. I’ve heard too many fellow white people say that when all these ‘racist old people’ die off then we’ll be fine but we all know that racism is not limited to old white people and that the alt-right is littered with white millennials. Check your friends and family on bigoted and racist remarks. Be a good ally. Sitting back for old people to die is not good allyship and you’ll soon see that they are not the only racists in power.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718564913579163648/rapunzelie-the-idea-that-racism-will-die-out-with"}]
