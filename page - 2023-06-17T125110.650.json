Add sexuality on top of that, and it’s an extra weight to carry around. It was painful not having anyone to look up to that looked like me growing up. It told me that there’s no way I can do music or be an actor because I couldn’t name one person who was doing it. That’s why I made the decision to hide [my sexual orientation]. But once I was no longer afraid, I worked on getting rid of that fear and that shame. It’s an ongoing journey, but I am realizing there’s a lot of power and beauty in that. It’s a gift.<br></small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/716615454377000960/candicespatton-black-people-experience-so-much"},{"originalPostURL":"https://saintmichaelthearchangel.tumblr.com/post/155292563877","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nI’m very powerful.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And maybe it’s not such a good idea for you to piss me off.\n\n</b></i><br></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/716615451665383424/saintmichaelthearchangel-im-very-powerful"},{"originalPostUsername":"gladersmaze","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p><small><i>Did I ever tell you about… when I broke my leg? It was way back in the Maze. I’d just come up from the box, just like all the other guys. Didn’t know where I was, didn’t know who I was. Even though all my memories were gone, I could still feel… that something was missing. I felt empty. I just—I couldn’t handle that. I couldn’t take it. So one morning, I got up early and I snuck out into the Maze, and I went and found the tallest wall I could. And I climbed up there and… I jumped off it. Of course I got completely tangled up in all the ivy. Snapped my leg in three different places, like a proper shank. I landed hard on the floor. I thought that was it. <b>Then Minho found me… somehow. He picked me up and took me back to the Glade. We never told anyone the truth about what happened. He saved me, he gave me a second chance. Now he needs us. So, if there is even the slightest chance that we can save him and we can get him out of there, then we have to take that.
