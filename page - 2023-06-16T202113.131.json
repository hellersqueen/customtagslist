He actually fought really hard for a scene where Quagmire rapes Marge Simpson to be aired on live TV – FOUGHT FOR IT, TOOTH AND NAIL – and is still angry that FOX wouldn’t let him get away with it.</p><p>He taught generations of young white guys that this shit was okay to say and believe because it was “just a joke” – hell, I’ll bet there’s a good Venn diagram between Family Guy fans and Trump supporters – and anyone who criticized him was just some boring, humorless PC police asshole.</p><p>And now people want to call his poorly-written, aggressively bigoted shit “satire” and give him brownie points for *appearing* progressive instead of actually being progressive.</p><p>Like, please demand more from your progressive allies than some fucking rich, white jackass who screams “Bigotry is cool! (Kidding)” in all his work, and does the bare fucking minimum every few years to be progressive.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073477588647936/biolosophy-a-grain-of-rice-samael"},{"originalPostURL":"https://viria.tumblr.com/post/70296124179","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>whoops I piperjasoned accidentally..</p><p>now back to studying</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073474909503488/viria-whoops-i-piperjasoned-accidentally-now"},{"originalPostURL":"https://krobick.tumblr.com/post/129924555176","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>percabeth and gruniper ❥\n\n</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073472236666880/krobick-percabeth-and-gruniper"},{"originalPostURL":"https://liam-dunbarr.tumblr.com/post/92786499132","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>This broke my heart.&nbsp;</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073469558652928/makeoutwithyourposter-liam-dunbarr-this-broke"},{"originalPostUsername":"cuadrigas","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>i drew my wife</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073466898415616/cuadrigas-i-drew-my-wife"},{"originalPostURL":"https://kyohonda.tumblr.com/post/154651120721","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><small>fruits basket character aesthetics › yuki sohma ♡</small><br></p><blockquote><p><small>it’s not that i’ve suddenly become stronger or that something has changed. i’m still shaking. but, we don’t have to let those fears stop us. what’s most important is that we try to rise above our weakness.</small></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073464225562624/kyohonda-fruits-basket-character-aesthetics"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073439302008832"},{"originalPostURL":"https://newtmos.tumblr.com/post/100990748909","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p><small><b>THE M I G H T Y GLADERS</b></small></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719073436575612928/newtmos-the-m-i-g-h-t-y-gladers"},{"originalPostURL":"https://thewincheters.tumblr.com/post/145732187542","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><small><b><a href=\"http://thewincheters.tumblr.com/tagged/spncp\">supernatural characters posters</a></b> | sam winchester</small></p><blockquote><div><i><small>At least my crazy’s all under one umbrella, you know?
