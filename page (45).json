I’m not saying you can’t use self depreciating humor to deal with stuff, but I would challenge you to really cut back on how much you talk about yourself in really negative ways. Because if you only ever talk about yourself as worthless garbage, that’s absolutely how you’re going to feel about yourself, and it’s really going to get in the way of your personal growth and developing a more healthy self image. Start small, start slow, but try to be kinder to yourself in the new year. Celebrate your little victories, forgive your setbacks, remember that you have worth and deserve happiness and love. You are not garbage.</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719962832470409216/i-am-so-on-board-with-2018-being-the-year-we"},{"originalPostURL":"https://kyrumption.tumblr.com/post/169201076548","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p><small><b><a href=\"http://kyrumption.tumblr.com/tagged/buffyverse%20sortings\">sorting buffyverse characters</a></b> // rupert giles - ravenclaw<br></small></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719962829811318784/kyrumption-sorting-buffyverse-characters"}]
