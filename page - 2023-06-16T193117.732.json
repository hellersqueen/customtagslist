He was a member of Slytherin house. </p><p>His accomplishments included the opening of Salazar Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets and the use of its monster to attack Muggle-born students; several months’ service as a purchasing agent for the Dark artefacts shop Borgin and Burkes; and the attainment of immortality between the years of 1942 and 1998, a process begun upon the creation of his first Horcrux at the age of 16. </p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417949316890624/sectvmsempras-tom-marvolo-riddle-later-known"},{"originalPostURL":"https://just-shower-thoughts.tumblr.com/post/135832246954","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                        <p>Why don’t jedis turn off their opponents lightsabers by force pressing the button?</p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417928804696064/is-that-what-i-think-it-is-dannysgreenpants"},{"originalPostURL":"https://sangsterthomrs.tumblr.com/post/134436261185","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p><b>make me choose </b>♡ <a href=\"http://sangsterthomrs.tumblr.com/post/134292939565/make-me-choose-newt-or-minho\">anonymous asked</a>: <i>newt</i> or minho<br></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"http://sangsterthomrs.tumblr.com/post/134293052625/for-your-mmc-newt-or-thomas\">anonymous asked</a>: <i>newt</i> or thomas</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Probably because&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you’re kind of&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the glue that holds</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;us all <i>together</i>.<br></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/719417922600288256/sangsterthomrs-make-me-choose-anonymous"},{"originalPostURL":"https://sorrynotsorrybi.tumblr.com/post/135185791716","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                        <p>Labels are meant to help <i>you </i>make sense of <i>yourself. </i>They are not for other people to dictate, and they are not set in stone.
