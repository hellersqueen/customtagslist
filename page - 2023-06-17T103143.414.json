Even if you think you’ve done a bad job and are ashamed of your work, or it’s way overdue, you take <i>whatever you can get</i>. Partial credit <i>dramatically</i> improves your grade over a zero, and I’m always astounded by how often even the smartest kids don’t really comprehend that. 60% is <i>worlds</i> better than 0%. Even 10% is going to help you. Letter grades are misleading and are not created equal. “F\"s are mathematically <i>valuable</i>.
