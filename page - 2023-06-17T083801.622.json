We’re supposed to drink too much. We’re supposed to have bad attitudes and shag each other’s brains out. We are designed to party. This is it. Yeah, so a few of us will overdose or go mental. But Charles Darwin said you can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. And that’s what it’s all about, breaking eggs! And by eggs, I do mean, getting twatted on a cocktail of Class As. If you could just see yourselves! It breaks my heart. You’re wearing cardigans! We had it all. We fucked up bigger and better than any generation that came before us. We were so beautiful! We’re screw-ups. I’m a screw-up and I plan to be a screw-up until my late 20s, maybe even my early 30s.

We all wake up and we have to tick the same Terms and Conditions box. Everyday stuff will happen to you. Some of it will be good, some of it will be bad. Choice is less about what happens than it is about how we deal with it. I’ve been thinking a lot about all the things that have happened to us over this past year. I won’t lie. Sometime’s it’s terrifying, and sometimes it’s incredibly exciting. It’s been maddening, enlightening, confusing, and always unpredictable.
