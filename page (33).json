I just slipped it into my pocket and walked out of the Wal-Mart and that was it. I remember I put it in a drawer and it just sat there because I was so afraid to wear it because it was this beautiful, bright tangerine color that I was sure, if someone asked me about it, I’d burst into tears, “I stole it! I’m so sorry!” So I could never wear it.</small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/720057295696986112/lizzie-mcguire-when-i-was-probably-in-junior"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/720057292981190656/surround-yourself-with-people-who-talk-about"},{"originalPostURL":"https://sindar.tumblr.com/post/160911709047","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><p>\n\n↳ moodboard: <b>hamilton</b><br></p><blockquote><p>I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory</p><p>This is where it gets me: on my feet</p><p>The enemy ahead of me</p><p>If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me</p><p>Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me</p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/720057290293657600/sindar-moodboard-hamilton-i-imagine"},{"originalPostURL":"https://chronic-life.tumblr.com/post/158852555889","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>Winter sunsets over the ocean</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/720057287638646784/chronic-life-winter-sunsets-over-the-ocean"},{"originalPostURL":"https://imagine-mystrade.tumblr.com/post/161093237299","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>The Prince and Princess of the Force (hear that @Lucasfilm?) in a quiet moment.
