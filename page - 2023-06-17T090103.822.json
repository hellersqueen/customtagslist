Her hair got scorched battling the Big Bad of the season, but instead of trying to cover up the scorched hair like she probably would have tried to do in the past, <b>she wears that temporary battle scar with pride.</b> It fits in with the theme of Buffy truly accepting and being content with her role as a Slayer in general, and even as The Chosen One, in specific.\n\n<br></p>\n                                                                    ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066053329076224/why-i-love-buffys-new-hair-style"},{"originalPostURL":"https://jostaa.tumblr.com/post/166867769595","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>compliments! he’s just not good at them</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066049697873921/jostaa-compliments-hes-just-not-good-at-them"},{"originalPostURL":"https://swnews.tumblr.com/post/167430952421","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><small>\n\nWhen we auditioned, it was a total cattle call, where they didn’t even tell us about the movie—we just went in and talked for a few minutes. Brian De Palma was looking for actors for Carrieand sitting next to him was George Lucas. Since Lucas didn’t speak the whole time, I thought he was De Palma’s assistant. I didn’t know what he looked like! So I did my thing, and a couple of weeks later, I went to my agent, and there were six or seven pages of audition material for me. By the time I got the part, I assumed that Harrison Ford was the lead, because he’s a traditional leading man. I thought I was going to be his sidekick, you know, like Captain America and Bucky.\n\n<br></small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066047014617088/swnews-when-we-auditioned-it-was-a-total"},{"originalPostURL":"https://frozenspots.tumblr.com/post/158409415598","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p>quick thing before sleep</p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066044316565504/frozenspots-quick-thing-before-sleep"},{"originalPostURL":"https://theavengers.tumblr.com/post/166606771825","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVeIt7GZvtA\">Two Truths and a Loki Lie</a></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066041660555264/theavengers-two-truths-and-a-loki-lie"},{"originalPostURL":"https://yourbuddyyourpalyourbucky.tumblr.com/post/167331746049","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p></p><blockquote><p><i>He’s my friend. <b>So was I</b></i></p></blockquote>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066038972071936/yourbuddyyourpalyourbucky-hes-my-friend-so-was"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066036286586880"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718066033610620928"}]
