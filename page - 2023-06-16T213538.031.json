I first met him in Kenneth Branagh’s house in England in 2009. We were mere children, in the very beginning of our acting journeys. We made an instant connection, and it’s been extraordinary to share the ride with him—this mad journey with Marvel. Anthony Hopkins has been on set this week. And Taika Waititi is magnificent. He has found a way of honoring everything that came before but doing his own thing. And he’s so funny. His films—and if you haven’t, you must seek them out: What We Do in the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople—they have this combination of light-hearted, good humor and emotion. They’re very moving. Everyone’s really happy.&nbsp;</i><br></small></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718493108164329472/hiddleston-daily-the-best-thing-about-it"},{"originalPostURL":"https://lauraholliis.tumblr.com/post/170240174143","postBodyContent":"\n                                                                    <p><i><small>I’m sorry that I let you believe i’m someone I’m not.</small></i></p>\n                                                                ","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718493105401331712/lauraholliis-im-sorry-that-i-let-you-believe-im"},{"originalPostUsername":"","postBodyContent":"","rebloggedPostURL":"https://getbacktofandomlife.tumblr.com/post/718493102656143360"}]
