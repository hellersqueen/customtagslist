tho??</p><ul><li>literally shoots chewing gum up peeves’ nose 20 seconds into his first lesson ever</li><li>passive-aggressively puts snape’s boggart in drag after snape insults neville in front of his class&nbsp;</li><li>and THEN, gives zero fucks about snape’s increasing rage as word gets around that HE DID THAT</li><li>speaking of gives zero fucks: gives zero fucks about trelawney’s attempts to crystal gaze for him<br></li><li>somehow miraculously bullshits his and harry’s way out of repercussions after snape catches harry with the map and has every right to put harry in detention for the rest of his life (AND he keeps composure while his teenage self is savagely badmouthing snape right in front of him, no less)</li><li>is prepared to straight up murder his former best friend in cold blood in front of 3 of his students and totally would have done it if not for harry’s intervention</li><li>gives harry the map back because, fuck it, he’s not a teacher anymore, give em hell, kid</li></ul><p>like i get the whole tea/sweaters/laid-back-professor aesthetic, but remus lupin is a magnificently flawed and sometimes straight up terrifying character…he’s so much more than fandom’s portrayal of him as this mild-mannered, careful person, and i think that part of the reason he’s so interesting to me is that he seems just like that at first, but you have all this dark shit lurking just beneath the surface. one of my favorite moments in the entire series is when he goes into that extremely scary place and he’s about to murder peter, because you know that each DADA professor so far has had some dark secret, and even beyond the werewolf reveal, remus’ payoff is SO good. he’s such a good character honestly</p>\n
